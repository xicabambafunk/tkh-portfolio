			<p class="desc">A short <a href="https://www.indigenousfriends.org/indigital">workshop</a> (which I found on IG) about Indigenous Futurism: a curriculum merging indigenous lessons, such as passed tales, smudging practices, indigenous struggles with coding and modern technology. Living in NY, I began to question spirituality/identity (not fitting in) and the beauty behind the planet's interconnectedness of forms and energies. For that reason, I was intrigued by this workshop's idea of "healing through technology," especially when it merged coding (which I was slowly learning independently) and spirituality (in indigenous practices). I'm currently looking to practice more code and broaden these ideas into more universal and inclusive projects (or generally in my own personal life).</p>

				<li>Daily opening/closing sharing circles, opening prayer and smudging.</li>
				<li>Seven Grandparents Teachings and an inclusive space.</li>

				<li>Lesson on Indigenous Futures and Afro-futurism.</li>
